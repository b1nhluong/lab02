According to the article, accessor methods (getters and setters) should be avoided unless absolutely necessary because they expose implementation details, making code harder to maintain and less object-oriented. However, there are a few scenarios where their use is acceptable:

Returning an Interface Object:
Itâ€™s okay for a method to return an object that implements an interface. This isolates external code from changes to the internal implementation of the object, maintaining flexibility without exposing internal fields.

Procedural Boundaries:
In cases where the object interacts with external systems (like databases or operating systems), which are inherently procedural, accessor methods might be unavoidable. Examples include APIs such as JDBC, where flexibility is prioritized to handle unpredictable usage.

JavaBeans and UI Construction Tools:
While JavaBeans traditionally rely on getters and setters for property management, these methods are intended for automated tools (like UI builders) to identify object properties through introspection. They are not meant to be called directly by programmers.
